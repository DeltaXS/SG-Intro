            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="Images/DMcBride.jpg" style="width: 200px"/><br/>
                I am 25 years old and interested in a career in programming after being introduced to the job
                and being able to work as a junior developer during my time in the Air Force.
            </p>
            <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                I worked as a Weather Forecaster in the Air force for 3 years after graduating from high school
                before accepting orders from Barksdale AFB Louisiana to Offutt AFB Nebraska where I 
                had the opportunity to train in Python in order to help the developers at the 16WS 
                to work on the AFWWEBS (Air Force Weather Web Services) web page.
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I am an avid gamer, on both console and PC, and particularly enjoy fighting games after being introduced to
                that community while playing the game Soul Calibur 5 during my time at Barksdale AFB.
